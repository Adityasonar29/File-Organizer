This is a great addition for your users! It explains how to turn your script into a global system command. I have updated the **Installation & Usage** section to include these specific instructions.

# Smart File Organizer Pro (Deterministic Engine)

A high-performance Python utility with a GUI that organizes cluttered directories into a structured hierarchy based on file categories and smart date extraction.

## 🧠 The Intelligence Engine

Unlike basic organizers that only look at "Date Modified," this tool uses a **Deterministic Priority System** to find the most accurate timestamp:

1. **Filename Analysis (Highest Priority):** Scans for `IMG_20220809` or `2022-08-09` patterns.
2. **Strict Calendar Validation:** Uses real Gregorian calendar logic. It won't accept "Month 13" or "February 30."
3. **Century Gatekeeping:** Only accepts years between `2000` and `2199` to avoid misidentifying random numbers.
4. **Metadata Fallback:** If no date is found in the name, it uses the OS file system metadata while preserving original timestamps.

## 📂 Project Structure

```text
file_organizer/
├── bin/
│   └── FileOrganizer.bat    # Windows Launcher
├── src/
│   └── main.py              # Core Logic
└── README.md

```

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 1. Basic Run

* Clone the repository.
* Navigate to the `bin/` folder and double-click `FileOrganizer.bat`.



## 🛠️ Features

* **Deterministic Sorting:** `Category > Subfolder > Year > Month`.
* **Duplicate Prevention:** Uses MD5 hashing to delete identical files.
* **Metadata Preservation:** Uses `shutil.copy2` to keep "Date Created" stamps original.
* **SQLite Logging:** Every move is tracked in `organizer_logs.db`.

### Pro-Tip for your GitHub

If you want to make the command even shorter (like just typing `org`), rename `FileOrganizer.bat` to `org.bat` inside your `bin` folder. Since you've added the folder to your Path, Windows will execute whatever name the file has!
